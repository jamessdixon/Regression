# Regression
McCaffrey's orginal code is found here: http://t.co/pIgwHvGh5K
I moved it from a Console project to a .dll and added a unit test project
I sperated his file into 2 files
I left his naming the same so that people can go from the MSDN article to the C# code to the F#

I started with the REPL with the intention to move to a compiled assembly to demonstrate the way <most> projects happen
